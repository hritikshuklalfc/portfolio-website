# Portfolio — Basics

This repository contains a lightweight portfolio website built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's intended to showcase projects, skills, and contact information as a personal portfolio.

**What you'll find**

- `index.html` — the portfolio homepage (projects, about, contact)
- `about.html` — extended bio or notes
- `app.js` — interactive behaviour and small demos used on the site
- `style.css` — site styles and responsive layout

**Features**

- Simple, static, and easy to host
- Responsive layout with CSS
- Lightweight JavaScript for interactivity (modals, project filters, contact form enhancements)

**Open locally**
From the `Basics` folder you can open the site directly or serve it locally:

```bash
# Open in default browser (macOS)
open index.html

# Or run a simple HTTP server (recommended)
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```

**Deployment**

- This is a static site — deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host.

**Customize**

- Edit `index.html` to add/remove sections or projects.
- Update `style.css` for typography, colors, and layout changes.
- Modify `app.js` to change interactive behaviours.

**Contact**

- Add your email, LinkedIn, or GitHub links to `index.html` (Contact section).

**License**

- Use as a personal portfolio template. Add a LICENSE file if you plan to publish under a specific license.
